## Sprint Retrospective
### What Went Well
The README instructions for building and running the project were clearly written and made setup simple for others.

The remaining game tasks were clearly identified and properly delegated among team members.

### What Could Be Improved
Bug management: A few persistent issues (clicking, turn visibility, and win condition) carried over to the end of the sprint, showing that earlier testing is needed in the sprint cycle.

Gameplay refinement: Visual polish and player engagement could be improved to enhance the overall experience.

### What to Improve Next Sprint
Increase test coverage: Begin playtesting earlier and more frequently to identify gameplay bugs and usability issues before the sprint ends.

### Key Learnings
Well-documented setup instructions (README) make it much easier for others to build and run the project independently.
