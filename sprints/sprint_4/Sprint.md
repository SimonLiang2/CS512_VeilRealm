## Sprint Retrospective
### What Went Well
Significant Bug Fixes Completed

All major gameplay bugs—including combat, collision, prefab issues, and turn-handling—were resolved by the end of the sprint.
Turn transitions (especially after attacks) now behave correctly.
Sprites and Decor implemented, making the game much more enjoyable to look at.

Multiple tasks (e.g., gameplay polishing) were completed collaboratively.

Prefabs corrected, layers fixed, and visuals unified.
Excess time allocated allowed for necessary things to be thoroughly polished.

### What Could Be Improved
Sprint hours started at 49. - Because polishing required revisiting, some excess time was allocated to fall back on.
Additionally, Piece Initialization wasn't worked on within this sprint due to lack of time.
(Reflected in the Burndown Chart)

Some bugs that needed to be fixed first delayed few parts of polishing.

### What to Improve Next Sprint
Subtasks for Features - Because Piece Initialization before the Gameplay has a lot of parts, we should try to divide up the main feature into smaller managable parts.

### Key Learnings
Polishing Gameplay and visuals (including bug fixes) enhances the game experience for players.
